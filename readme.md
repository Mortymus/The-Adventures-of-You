# The Amazing Adventures of You

My very first Python project made in October 2020 when i first started learning programming. 

My programming skills were as basic as they come, but I was exhilarated by the idea of being able to create some sort of game. It is heavily inspired by old school computer games such as Police Quest where the user had to enter a prompt to perform any actions. There are no moving graphics, just two choices for every frame, letting the story develop based on the user's decisions. Unfortunately, I never finished the storyline for all the alternatives since the storyline branched out in all different directions.

The most important lessons I learned from this project was how to use Tkinter to make graphic applications in Python, and how to use PyInstaller to create an executable from a python project. The repository includes the original python file and the executable, with all the messy history of its creation.
